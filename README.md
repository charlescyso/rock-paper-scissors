Rock, Paper, Scissors with Javascript!

Reflection:

This was the first project with Javascript involved, and it kind of kicked my ass. Looking at the playRound() function, there are areas where repeated code could've been shortened. This was also the first project I believe where math is involved, so I had to google my way through the Math() function. After this project, I felt more confident using getElementById and event listeners. I also upped my CSS game, adding a grow effect with :hover and transform, and I used classList.remove in javascript to remove the effect when the game was over. Overall I improved in my CSS and Javascript.
